The new Quenoth elves:

Short Description of Race:

The Quenoth elves are a subspecies of elves that obviously evolved from the nearly-extinct wood elves.
The Quenoth elves have adapted to life in the harsh, unforgiving desert, thus they have become crepuscular (with a few
exceptions).

Era:

In this era, there is an artifical sun known as Naia, thus the day cycle is very different.
Irdya has been greatly scathed after a failed attempt at creating another artifical sun, Gaia.
The kingdom of Wesnoth has been destroyed, forests have been burned, parts of the Great Continent
have sunken into the sea, and so forth.

Culture:

The culture of these elves differs from that of the wood elves. For exmaple, the Quenoth elves are willing to use
poison. They have also forgotten the ways of the fae as seen in the culture of the wood elves. For the spiritual members
of Quenoth society, there is a split in the ideas of how the Quenoth should carry out their lives. The Sand Dancers
have embraced the elements of earth and wind, thus they seek to have a strong connection to the desert. The Mystics
seek to be like the beings depicted in their legends that tell of when a great being (Xia'el) came to Irdya long ago
and left her descendants (primordial faeries, thus very earlier ancestors of elves) to live there.
