Hunter line (melee fighters):

The Hunter line is essentially a fusion between the old Fighter and Hunter lines. Like the Fighter line, there
is a strong focus on melee. From the old Hunter line, we have the bolas, which provide impact damage and the slows
weapon special. One branch focuses on leadership, while the other focuses on power. Wields swords.

Archer line (ranged fighters):

Just the good ol' archer line, but without the Ranger branch.
