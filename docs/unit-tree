Hunter line (melee fighters):

The Hunter line is essentially a fusion between the old Fighter and Hunter lines. Like the Fighter line, there is a strong focus on melee. From the old Hunter line, we have the bolas, which provide impact damage and the slows weapon special. One branch focuses on leadership, while the other focuses on power. Wields swords.

Archer line (ranged fighters):

Just the good ol' archer line, but without the Ranger branch.

Sand Dancers (scouts):

The Sand Dancer line is the scout line. Sand Dancers wield claws and deliver many swift, weak, graceful
blows. At the L2 stage, magical powers are developed. One branch focuses on developing its offensive
magical powers, while the other focuses on stealth. The branch that focuses on stealth has the ability
to conceal while on sandy terrain.

Mystics (healers):

The main role of the Mystic line is to heal. Each branch of the Mystic line differs greatly. The neutral
line is like a fusion between the wood Druid and Sorceress. The neutral line focuses on healing (, arcane
aura-based magic, ... getting a bit too powerful, perhaps?) along with remnants of plant-based magic:
poisonous thorns.

The lawful line intends to be like the primordial beings mentioned in legend, thus they wield fire-based
magic. The L3 of this line has the ability to manipulate how it is percieved by other beings during the day; in the actual game, this power is manifested as the ability to conceal itself during the day. The L3 has brilliant dragonfly wings.

The chaotic line is also faerie-like, but due to desire, lifestyle, and the embracing of the night, members of this line have developed differently. Members of this line wield cold-based magic. The L3 of this line
has developed moth wings that glisten beautifully at night. The wings resemble the wings of this moth: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Actias_luna_female_sjh.JPG). The wings of the L3 are also coated with a poisonous powder.
