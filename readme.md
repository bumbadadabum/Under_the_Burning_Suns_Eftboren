Under the Burning Suns: Eftboren
================================================================================

Under the Burning Suns: Eftboren (or Eftboren, for short) is a modified mainline campaign for the 
game [Battle for Wesnoth] [1].

"In the distant future a small band of elves struggles to survive amidst the ruins 
of fallen empires. Lead your people out of the desert on an epic journey to find a 
new home."

Installing Eftboren
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future, when a version of Eftboren is released on the add-ons server it's suggested you install it via Battle for Wesnoth’s built-in add-ons manager,
which can be accessed via the “Add-ons Manager” button in the main menu.

Players who know how to use [Git] [2] and are interested in testing the latest
(unstable, buggy) version of Eftboren may clone our Git repository, which is to
be found [on GitHub] [3], into Battle for Wesnoth’s
“[userdata][4]/data/add-ons/” directory.
